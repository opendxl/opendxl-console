# The webRoot directory:
# the directory that the servlet engine regards as the place where applications 
# that use the servlet engine should be installed.  Generally, it is safe to leave
# this at the default setting of __AUTODETECT__.  When the SmartClient server is
# started, it logs a message to stdout telling you the autodetected path to your
# webRoot.  If this path is not your actual webRoot, then you'll want to override
# this config parameter here.
#
# Valid values: 
#
# 1. Absolute path to the webRoot directory
#
# 2. Special token:  __AUTODETECT__
#    When this token is used, SmartClient attempts to auto-detect the webRoot using
#    standard servlet APIs.  This may or may not work - depending on your
#    container type and deployment type.  For example, WAR/EAR deployments
#    on some containers never make it to disk, and so the container refuses
#    to provide the webRoot path.
#  
#    If SmartClient cannnot detect the webRoot, it sets the webRoot to
#    __USE_CONTAINER__ (see below).
#
# 3.  Special token: __USE_CONTAINER__
#     When this token is used, SmartClient uses standard servet APIs for accessing
#     filesystem resources.  This is slower than direct file access and, since
#     the servlet APIs provide no mechanism for writing to disk, means that some
#     development tools like the FileAssembler will not work.
#
webRoot: __AUTODETECT__

# if you've moved the isomorphic directory from its default location in webRoot,
# set the root-relative path to it here
#
# For example, if in your deployment the 'isomorphic' dir is in /foo/bar, then set
# then you'll need to set this to foo/bar/isomorphic
isomorphicPathRootRelative: isomorphic

# -------------- PICK DATABASE TO USE --------------------
#
# The SmartClient SDK ships with examples that use a database as the persistence
# layer.  By default, the SDK uses a built-in version of HSQLDB, but you can 
# specify a different database to use here.

# which database do you want to use?  HSQLDB is enabled by default.
sql.defaultDatabase: HSQLDB
# Publish the JDBC endpoint for the defaultDatabase via JNDI at the specified path for use by
# other frameworks such as Spring, Hibernate, etc.
# Note that we do not use the java:comp or java:comp/env prefix because that
# subtree is read-only on Tomcat (and possibly other containers) due to security
# considerations

# -------------- LOADING APP AND DATASOURCE DEFINITIONS --------------------

# Where the system looks for DataSource definition files ([dataSourceId].ds.xml or

# -------------- JMS Configuration for Real Time Messaging  --------------------
# If you comment in the properties below, the simple messaging example will work
# against Active MQ JMS instead.  Be sure to start your ActiveMQ server and double
# check the configuraition below, notably the TCP endpoint of your ActiveMQ server.
# If you make changes here, you'll also need to modify ActiveMQ's jndi.properties
# also located in WEB-INF/classes
#
# You'll also need to drop the ActiveMQ jar into WEB-INF/lib - it's typically
# named apache-activemq-4.1.1.jar or similar.
